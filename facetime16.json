The project is a kind of life simulator, where the player independently not only creates his character, his environment, but also his own rules of the game. There are practically no restrictions on the creation and arrangement of your world. The player can invent and create various life situations, which can be limited only by the author\u2019s imagination.<img src=\"https:\/\/wisegeek.ru\/kartinki\/aac\/1301-1600\/1306.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

You can choose any image from the suggested ones. Next, the world of Life CityToca and the character system are built, where you can create new heroes. Then the game will take you to your first apartment. This is where you can start your adventure. At the house you will be greeted by the main characters of the animated series - Rita and Nari. At the start of the game, you get the opportunity to create an image of any of the 8 heroes, and you will also have access to several locations. You can immediately try your abilities in movement and interaction with the heroes.\r\n\r\nAnother building that you can visit at the start is the post office. If you received a gift, a red circle will light up above the house. To receive a present, you need to go to the post office and tap on the transport container. After that, your gift will appear on the tape.<img src=\"https:\/\/wisegeek.ru\/kartinki\/aac\/1301-1600\/1306-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

On the loading screen, where the settings are located, and the \"Play\" button, there is a button in the form of a shopping cart, colored green. This is Toki\u2019s shop. After entering it, you should scroll through all the shopping offers to the very bottom, until you see a button that says: \"Restore all purchases.\" You should click on it. After that, the progress of the operation with the inscription: \"Wait\" will appear on the screen. After a few seconds, \"Excellent! Everything is ready!\" After that, you need to go into the game and check if this trick worked for you. All paid locations and buildings should appear in your Toki world.<img src=\"https:\/\/games.lol\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/Toca-Life-World-Matchplay..jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

There are places for cooking in the Apartment, in (your) designer houses (if you want to put a hob and oven). All ingredients can be found in locations and secret places (we wrote about some below). Sometimes you can go into any available building and see if you can profit from something. Do not hesitate to borrow food from your neighbors, they will come in handy for a variety of game moments and fictional stories. It should be noted that cooking is not overshadowed by the presence of additional appliances (ovens, dishes, and so on). You just need to take the right ingredients and combine them in your character\u2019s hand. And to set the table beautifully, there are various culinary decorations and special dishes.<img src=\"https:\/\/img.utdstc.com\/screen\/c55\/544\/c555443514882bbdc5634d408c5c40befe66bf55db06997b04dfe3262cbf9571:800\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

It is an abandoned park, in the center of which there is an old castle. At the park gate, a detective is sitting on a bench with a few clues in his briefcase. One picture shows a statue of a lion with a button on it. Once inside the castle, you can see this statue at the elevator. Lower the lion\u2019s head to reveal a secret niche in the wall. In the niche, you should take a picture, and also get a scroll from the box - this is a hint for you. On the ground floor there is another painting in green tones (hanging on the wall to the right of the elevator). Put the clue, the picture from the safe and the green picture in the elevator.\r\n\r\nOn the second floor, to the right of the elevator, there are 5 candles on the wall, under which 5 paintings should be hung. The format of the images should match the footprint of the painting on the wall. The oval painting is in a chest under the window on the 2nd floor. There is a second clue in the same chest. Take it, and place the picture in the right place on the wall. A vertical rectangular canvas with a cast stands near a gramophone. Raise it and other artwork into place (as shown in the picture above).<img src=\"https:\/\/wisegeek.ru\/kartinki\/aac\/1301-1600\/1306-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"360\"></div>",

All ingredients can be found in the first city of Bob City. First, let’s go to Rita’s apartment, which is located in a high-rise residential building in the city. Here you need to find a blue joystick, and pass it to Zeke, without getting it from the bottom panel of the heroes. The joystick can be anywhere if you moved it earlier.

There is no guarantee that they are 100% safe. Indeed, in 2017, Google\u2019s staff members were forced to take more than seven hundred thousand apps off the website, since they violated Google Play\u2019s reasonable policies.<\/p><div class=\"quads-location quads-ad3\" id=\"quads-ad3\" style=\"float:none;margin:10px 0 10px 0;text-align:center;\"> <ins class=\"adsbygoogle\" style=\"display:block\" data-ad-client=\"ca-pub-1862859532624719\" data-ad-slot=\"4811711230\" data-ad-format=\"auto\" data-full-width-responsive=\"true\"><\/ins> <script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});<\/script> <\/div><p>This group of apps includes more than 7,000 apps that violated Google\u2019s safety measures \u2013 thus presenting an unknown, and potentially very dangerous, security risks. Plus, this group includes many malware apps, which would have engaged in SMS fraud and phishing, as well as delivering Trojan viruses to operating systems.<\/p><p>It\u2019s true, of course, that an app downloaded off the APKPure service is also not necessarily completely secure. The site allows users to upload their apps. When you open a service like that up to the community \u2013 security risks are always present.<\/p><p>However, the staff and customer-support personnel of APKPure have historically been open and honest with their users. They have worked with them through problems and notified them of potential, developing security risks.<\/p><p>Plus, the market of people using APKPure is much smaller than the incredibly vast market of people using the Play Store.

This will tide you over until the new one is repaired.

Every mod that is uploaded to the catalog is there for users to test, and the developers only ask that you comment on how good the mod is, whether there are any problems, what doesn\u2019t work and what can be improved. They then use those comments to move the best mods to the top of the list. You can help by testing mods and telling everyone what you think of them and by uploading any mods that you find too.<\/div>",
